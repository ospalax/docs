Importing Docker Hub Images
================================================================================

`Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com>`_ is the official, public, and free `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ image repository.

OpenNebula provides integration with Docker Hub via a dedicated :ref:`marketplace <market_dh>` driver. It allows to easily import these DockerHub images to the OpenNebula cloud. The OpenNebula context packages are installed during the import process so once an image is imported itâ€™s fully prepared to be used. Such images can be used to run as Firecracker micro-VMs, LXD system containers or KVM virtual machines.
