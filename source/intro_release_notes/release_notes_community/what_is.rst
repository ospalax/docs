What Is OpenNebula Community Edition
====================================

OpenNebula is an open source cloud management platform that combines virtualization and container technologies with multi-tenancy, automatic provision and elasticity to offer on-demand applications and services on enterprise, hybrid and edge environments.

The Community Edition (CE) of OpenNebula is a fully-featured version of OpenNebula released under Apache License 2.0 for the community. The Community Edition of OpenNebula is updated and released every six months and maintained through the Community Forum. Our GitHub provides all the details of the `OpenNebula Release Cycle Policy <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/wiki/Release-Policy>`__.
