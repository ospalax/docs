Overview
================================================================================

This chapter introduces the Networking model that OpenNebula follows to manage vCenter networking resources. This includes integration with NSX-t and NSX-v.

How Should I Read This Chapter
================================================================================

You should be reading this chapter after performing the :ref:`vCenter node install <vcenter_node>` and reading the :ref:`vCenter Storage Setup <vmware_storage_setup>` chapter.

This chapter introduces the :ref:`vCenter Networking <virtual_network_vcenter_usage>` section that outlines how OpenNebula can consume or create networks and how those networks can be used, as well as the :ref:`NSX Setup Section <nsx_setup>` that introduces the integration of OpenNebula with the NSX component.

The next step should be proceeding to the :ref:`Operations guide <operation_guide>` to learn how the cloud users can consume the cloud resources that have been set up.

Hypervisor Compatibility
================================================================================

All this chapter applies exclusively to vCenter hypervisor.
