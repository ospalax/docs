How Should I Read This Chapter
================================================================================

After reviewing and understanding the contents of the :ref:`operation guide <operation_guide>` pertinent to your particular cloud infrastructure, you can use this reference Sections to look for the meaning of particular attributes that may be interesting to fine tune the behavior of different resources.

Within this Chapter, you can find references for the templates of :ref:`images <img_template>`, :ref:`templates <template>` and :ref:`virtual networks <vnet_template>`.Also you can find references to all the commands of the :ref:`command line interface <cli>`, and a state machine describing all the :ref:`VM life-cycle states <vm_states>`.
